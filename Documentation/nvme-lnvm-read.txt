DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Read command reads the logical blocks specified by the command
from the medium. 

OPTIONS
-------
-n <nsid>::
--namespace-id=<nsid>::
	Read the data from the given nsid namespace.

-s <slba>::
--start-block=<slba>::
	Start logical block.

-c <nlb>::
--block-count=<nlb>::
	Logical block count.

-z <size>::
--data-size=<size>::
	Number of bytes data will be read from the medium. 
	The size is no more than 4096.

-d <data-file>::
--data=<data-file>::
	File to store data read from the mediun.     

-p <prinfo>::
--prinfo=<prinfo>::
	Protection information. 
	This is optional.

-l::
--limited-retry::
	If set to '1', the controller should apply limited retry efforts.
	If cleaned to '0', the controller should apply all available error 
	recovery means to return the data to the host.
	This is optional.

-f::
--force-unit-access::
	If set to '1', data should be returned from non-volatile media.
	This is optional.

-i::
--incompressible::
	If set to '1', data should be returned from non-volatile media.
	If cleaned to '0', then no information on compression is provided.
	This is optional.

-r::
--sequential-request::
	If set to '1', this command is part of a sequential read that includes 
	multiple Read command.
	If cleaned to '0', then no information on sequential access is provided.
	This is optional.

-d <latency>::
--access-latency=<latency>::
	Access latency.
	This is optional.
