DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Write command writes the logical blocks specified by the command
to the medium. 

OPTIONS
-------
-n <nsid>::
--namespace-id=<nsid>::
	Write the data to the given nsid namespace.

-s <slba>::
--start-block=<slba>::
	Start logical block.

-c <nlb>::
--block-count=<nlb>::
	Logical block count.

-z <size>::
--data-size=<size>::
	Number of bytes data will be written to the medium. 
	The size is no more than 4096.

-d <data-file>::
--data=<data-file>::
	File to store data written to the mediun.     

-p <prinfo>::
--prinfo=<prinfo>::
	Protection information. 
	This is optional.

-l::
--limited-retry::
	If set to '1', the controller should apply limited retry efforts.
	If cleaned to '0', the controller should apply all available error 
	recovery means to write the data to the NVM.
	This is optional.

-f::
--force-unit-access::
	If set to '1', data should be written to non-volatile media before 
	indicating command completion.
	This is optional.

-i::
--incompressible::
	If set to '1', data is not compressible for the logical blocks indicated.
	If cleaned to '0', then no information on compression is provided.
	This is optional.

-r::
--sequential-request::
	If set to '1', this command is part of a sequential write that includes 
	multiple Write command.
	If cleaned to '0', then no information on sequential access is provided.
	This is optional.

-d <latency>::
--access-latency=<latency>::
	Access latency.
	This is optional.

|1|Idle. Longer latency acceptable. 
|2|Normal. Typical latency. 
|3|Low. Smallest possible latency. 
|==================

-p <freq>::
--access-frequency=<freq>::
	Access frequency.
	This is optional.

|==================
|Freq|Description
|0|No frequency information provided. 
|1|Typical number of reads and writes expected for the LBA range. 
|2|Infrequent writes and infrequent reads to the LBA range indicated.
|3|Infrequent writes and frequent reads to the LBA range indicated.
|4|Frequent writes and infrequent reads to the LBA range indicated.
|5|Frequent writes and frequent reads to the LBA range indicated.
|6|One time write.
|7-15|Reserved.
